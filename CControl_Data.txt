Layout:
    Pipe_Sources:  Can set up to 10 seperate release points. 
    Releases are each location are near surface within a circle of diameter rand_spread meters. 

    FullBay:  Particles are placed near surface at each of the nodes within the domain. As there are 
    more particles than nodes, there will be a spread of points around each node of diameter "rand_spread" m. 

    BoxRows, BorderBay are out of date, and should be removed.
    particles.cpp contains the routine which sets the initial Particle positions:
    void PPartInit(struct PPart *host_P, struct MMesh *MM, 
           struct CControl *CC, int num_P)

Release modes:
    The particles are released into the grid when time_now passes PP[ip].Release_time.
    All times use real times expressed in seconds. MM[0].time_init, MM[0].time_now 
    PPartInit sets Release_time according to several choices:
    
    All at once, with no time delay:
    PP[ip].Release_time = MM[0].time_init + 0.0;

    Increment time of release:
      Particles appear continuously until all are moving.
    ReleaseIncrement is set as time spacing between.  Will affect duration of releasing.
    Particle number ip will be released after ReleaseIncrement*ip, its order in the large array.    
    PP[ip].Release_time = MM[0].time_init + CC->ReleaseIncrement*ip;  

    Pulse releases.
        Can be used to emphasize groups of particles released at particular points in the tidal cycle.
        Specify:
        pulse_duration: The duration of a pulse, say 1 hour = 3600.s, 
        pulse_spacing:  Time between pulses: , 
                        say every 1/2 lunar cycle = 12.42 / 2. = 22356. sec.   
            PP[ip].Release_time = MM[0].time_init + 1.+ ip*CC->ReleaseIncrement;
              + floor(CC->ReleaseIncrement*ip/(CC->pulse_duration)) *(CC->pulse_spacing);

    The Release modes are all actually the same equation as Pulse Release. 
    For each mode these values must be set:
        Pulse releases:
            pulse_spacing
            pulse_duration
            ReleaseIncrement
        Incremental releases:
            pulse_spacing = 0.0;
            pulse_duration = 1.0;
            ReleaseIncrement
        All at once:
            pulse_spacing = 0.0;
            pulse_duration = 1.0;
            ReleaseIncrement = 0.0;

Color Modes:
    Colors are specified by a color map which is continuous through 
    the first six rgb colors: 
    red     100
    yellow  110
    green   010
    teal    110
    blue    001
    cyan    101
    red     100
    Alternate colormaps should be considered.
    The colormap is applied in the shader.vs. The input to the shader is
    through the fourth variable of the pos[] 4vector [X,Y,Z,C]
    C (aka ColorClass) carries a couple of other details.  
    C=0 is a white border point.
    C=1 is an invisible point, used for grounded or not yet running points
    C = 2.0 - 7.9  The projection into the color map.
    The projectio to the shader color array is 
    Color = vec4(r,g,b,1.0);
    The fourth location is a transparency. For now hard coded in the shader.vs
    The width of the ColorMap when used to register time is set by 
    age_class, which is supposed to correspond to 0-6 colors to represent classes by age.
    It might be used to represent the full time scale of the colormap 0-6 = 0-ageclass
    
    ColorByRelease=0: Color by time at release:
        Each is different color at release, so the source slowly blends through 
        the color map. Each keeps its initial color as it moves around.
            double agesec = PP[Ip].Release_time - MM[0].time_init;
            double NumColors = 6.; 
            ColorClass = (agesec/MM[0].age_class) ; 
            while (ColorClass > NumColors) ColorClass-=NumColors;
            ColorClass+=2.; 

    ColorByAge=1:  Age since release: 
        All are same color at release, and blend through the color map
        as they age. ageclass scales time to the colormap. 
            double agesec = PP[Ip].Release_time - MM[0].time_now;
            double NumColors = 6.; 
            ColorClass = (agesec/MM[0].age_class) ; 
            while (ColorClass > NumColors) ColorClass-=NumColors; 
            ColorClass+=2.; 
 
    ColorByPulse=2: 
        Related to Release by Pulse, this is intended to color each 
        released pulse uniquely to identify paths by phase of tide.
                double agesec = PP[Ip].Release_time - MM[0].time_init;
                double NumColors = 6.; 
                ColorClass = floor(agesec/MM[0].pulse_spacing) ; //% NumColors;

    ColorByDepth=3:
        Scale depth into ColorClass using depthcolorinterval
            double NumColors = 6.; 
            ColorClass = -(PP[Ip].z_present/MM[0].depthcolorinterval); 
            while (ColorClass > NumColors) ColorClass-=NumColors; 
            ColorClass+=2.; 

    ColorByOrigin=4:  Color by the point of origin. By Pipe number for Pipe_Sources,
    or by location, by Longitude for FullBay.  Not yet implemented.


Movement State:
    Fundamental modes are : 
    moving=1, waiting=3, aground=2, white border=0 {PP[ip].state= 0,1,2,3}
    Each time step the modes are evaluated relative to their Release Schedule 
    and current mode.
    Only moving are passed through the moving calculations.
    All are plotted, and therefore evaluated for Color Mode.
